            <p>I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in computer science.
                Having been born in California and raised in South Korea, and then having gone to high school and college in Minnesota, I consider myself a rather multicultural individual.
                I started my lifting journey in college and was soon introduced to powerlifting by my peers.
                My passion for training, coupled with a desire to help other like-minded people, led me to dream of building a gym with where people could fully lock in on achieving their goals.
                I am determined to make Undisputed Power the true embodiment of this dream.
